# Story Generation & Completion ChatBot

## Overview
  This project aims to create a story generation and completion chatbot that can generate complete stories and complete partial ones. The core of the project is based on the 
  **LLaMA-3 model**, which is highly effective for creating chatbots. Through prompt engineering, various story-related features were incorporated to enhance the user 
  experience.

## Features
  The chatbot offers the following features:
  
  1. Story Plot
  2. Story Length
  3. Creativity
  4. Narrative Perspective
  5. Genre
  6. Character Name
  7. Character Description
  8. Setting Description

  
## Technology Stack
  
  ### Backend
  1. **LLaMA-3 Model:** Utilized for its superior capabilities in chatbot creation and story generation.
  2. **LangChain:** Employed for effective prompt engineering to achieve the desired functionality.
  3. **FastAPI:** Used to integrate the model code with the UI code, ensuring seamless communication between the backend and the front end.
  
  ### Frontend
  We implemented two methods for the UI:
