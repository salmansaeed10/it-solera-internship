This Python script creates a chatbot capable of answering questions based on information extracted from PDF documents. It leverages the following key technologies:

LangChain: A framework for building LLM applications, providing components for prompt engineering, retrieval, and memory management.
Groq: A cloud-based platform for running large language models.
Pinecone: A vector database for storing and retrieving embeddings.
Hugging Face Embeddings: A library for generating embeddings from text.
PDF Processing: Extracts text from PDF documents using DirectoryLoader and PyPDFLoader.
Text Chunking: Splits extracted text into smaller chunks for efficient processing.
Vector Embedding: Creates vector representations of text chunks using Hugging Face embeddings.
Vector Storage: Stores embeddings in a Pinecone vector database for efficient retrieval.
RetrievalQA Chain: Combines retrieval and question-answering capabilities for effective response generation.
Conversation Memory: Maintains a conversation history to provide context-aware responses.
Workflow Breakdown:

Load Environment Variables: Loads API keys for Groq and Pinecone from a .env file.
Extract PDF Data: Extracts text from PDF documents in a specified directory.
Create Text Chunks: Splits extracted text into smaller chunks.
Generate Embeddings: Creates vector embeddings for each text chunk using Hugging Face embeddings.
Store Embeddings: Stores embeddings in a Pinecone vector database.
Initialize RetrievalQA Chain: Sets up the retrieval chain using Groq LLM, Pinecone retriever, and ConversationBufferMemory.
User Interaction: Continuously prompts the user for input and processes the response using the retrieval chain.
Key Features:

Contextual Understanding: Maintains a conversation history to provide context-aware responses.
Information Retrieval: Efficiently retrieves relevant information from the vector database.
Question Answering: Generates informative responses based on the retrieved information.
Customizability: Can be easily adapted to different use cases by modifying the prompt template, LLM model, and retrieval parameters.
Potential Enhancements:

Fine-Tune LLM: Fine-tune the LLM on specific medical data to improve response accuracy.
Expand Document Sources: Incorporate additional document formats (e.g., Word, Excel).
Implement Knowledge Graph: Create a knowledge graph to represent relationships between entities in the documents.
Integrate External APIs: Connect to external APIs for real-time information or services.
