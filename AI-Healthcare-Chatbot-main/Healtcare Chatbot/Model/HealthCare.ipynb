With appropriate care, the binding should last the useful life of the book. Keep in mind that putting \\nexcessive flattening pressure on any binding will accelerate its failure. If you purchased a book that you believe is defective, please immediately return it to the place of purchase. If you encounter ongoing issues, you can also contact Customer Service at our publisher, McGraw Hill.\\nSTART EARLY: Use this book as early as possible while learning the basic medical sciences. The first semester of \\nyour first year is not too early! Devise a study plan by reading Section I: Guide to Efficient Exam Preparation, and make an early decision on resources to use by checking Section IV: Top-Rated Review Resources. Note that First Aid is neither a textbook nor a comprehensive review book, and it is not a panacea for inadequate preparation. \\nCONSIDER FIRST AID YOUR ANNOTATION HUB: Annotate this book with material from other resources, \\nsuch as class notes or comprehensive textbooks. This will keep all the high-yield information you need in one place. \\nOther tips on keeping yourself organized:\\n \\x83For best results, use fine-tipped ballpoint pens (eg, BIC Pro+, Uni-Ball Jetstream Sports, Pilot Drawing Pen, Zebra F-301). If you like gel pens, try Pentel Slicci, and for markers that dry almost immediately, consider Staedtler Triplus Fineliner, Pilot Drawing Pen, and Sharpies.\\n \\x83Consider using pens with different colors of ink to indicate different sources of information (eg, blue for USMLE-Rx Step 1 Qmax, green for UWorld Step 1 Qbank, red for Rx Bricks).\\n \\x83Choose highlighters that are bright and dry quickly to minimize smudging and bleeding through the page (eg, Tombow Kei Coat, Sharpie Gel).\\n \\x83Many students de-spine their book and get it 3-hole-punched. This will allow you to insert materials from other sources, including curricular materials. \\nINTEGRATE STUDY WITH CASES, FLASH CARDS, AND QUESTIONS: To broaden your learning strategy, consider integrating your First Aid study with case-based reviews (eg, First Aid Cases for the USMLE Step 1), flash cards (eg, USMLE-Rx Step 1 Flash Facts), and practice questions (eg, the USMLE-Rx Step 1 Qmax). Read the chapter in the book, then test your comprehension by using cases, flash cards, and questions that cover the same topics. Maintain access to more comprehensive resources (eg, ScholarRx Bricks and USMLE-Rx Step 1 Express videos) for deeper review as needed.\\nPRIME YOUR MEMORY: Return to your annotated Sections II and III several days before taking the USMLE \\nStep 1. The book can serve as a useful way of retaining key associations and keeping high-yield facts fresh in your memory just prior to the exam. The Rapid Review section includes high-yield topics to help guide your studying.\\nCONTRIBUTE TO FIRST AID: Reviewing the book immediately after your exam can help us improve the next \\nedition. Decide what was truly high and low yield and send us your comments. Feel free to send us scanned images from your annotated First Aid book as additional support. Of course, always remember that all examinees are under agreement with the NBME to not disclose the specific details of copyrighted test material.\\nFAS1_2024_00_Frontmatter.indd   17FAS1_2024_00_Frontmatter.indd   17 1/31/24   11:07 AM1/31/24   11:07 AM'),\n",

As a medical student, you are no doubt familiar with taking standardized examinations and quickly absorbing large amounts of material. When you first confront the USMLE Step 1, however, you may find it all too easy to become sidetracked from your goal of studying with maximal effectiveness. Common mistakes that students make when studying for Step 1 include the following:\\n \\x83Starting to study (including First Aid) too late\\n \\x83Starting to study intensely too early and burning out\\n \\x83Starting to prepare for boards before creating a knowledge foundation\\n \\x83Using inefficient or inappropriate study methods\\n \\x83Buying the wrong resources or buying too many resources\\n \\x83Buying only one publisher’s review series for all subjects\\n \\x83Not using practice examinations to maximum benefit\\n \\x83Not understanding how scoring is performed or what the result means\\n \\x83Not using review books along with your classes\\n \\x83Not analyzing and improving your test-taking strategies\\n \\x83Getting bogged down by reviewing difficult topics excessively\\n \\x83Studying material that is rarely tested on the USMLE Step 1\\n \\x83Failing to master certain high-yield subjects owing to overconfidence\\n \\x83Using First Aid as your sole study resource\\n \\x83Trying to prepare for it all alone\\nIn this section, we offer advice to help you avoid these pitfalls and be more productive in your studies.\\n\\u2009`USMLE STEP 1—THE  BASICS\\nThe USMLE Step 1 is the first of three examinations that you would normally pass in order to become a licensed physician in the United States. The USMLE is a joint endeavor of the National Board of Medical \\nExaminers (NBME) and the Federation of State Medical Boards (FSMB). The USMLE serves as the single examination system domestically and internationally for those seeking medical licensure in the United States.\\nThe Step 1 exam includes test items that can be grouped by the organiza-\\ntional constructs outlined in Table 1 (in order of tested frequency). In late 2020, the USMLE increased the number of items assessing communication skills. While pharmacology is still tested, they are focusing on drug mecha-nisms rather than on pharmacotherapy. You will not be required to identify the specific medications indicated for a specific condition. Instead, you will be asked more about drug mechanisms and side effects. `The test at a glance:\\n \\x83 8-hour exam\\n \\x83 Up to a total of 280 multiple choice items\\n \\x83 7 test blocks (60 min/block)\\n \\x83 Up to 40 test items per block\\n \\x83 45 minutes of break time, plus another 15 \\nif you skip the tutorial\\nFAS1_2024_00_Section_I.indd   2FAS1_2024_00_Section_I.indd   2 1/29/24   1:15 PM1/29/24   1:15 PM'),\n",

A short 11-question survey follows the last question block. The computer begins the survey with a prompt to proceed to the next block of questions. \\nOnce an examinee finishes a particular question block on the CBT, he or \\nshe must click on a screen icon to continue to the next block. Examinees cannot go back and change their answers to questions from any previously \\ncompleted block. However, changing answers is allowed within a block of questions as long as the block has not been ended and if time permits.\\nWhat Is the CBT Like?\\nGiven the unique environment of the CBT, it’s important that you become familiar ahead of time with what your test-day conditions will be like. You can access a 15-minute tutorial and practice blocks at http://orientation.nbme.org/Launch/USMLE/STPF1. This tutorial interface is the same as the one you will use in the exam; learn it now and you can skip taking it during the exam, giving you up to 15 extra minutes of break time. You can gain experience with the CBT format by taking the 120 practice questions (3 blocks with 40 questions each) available online for free (https://www.usmle.org/prepare-your-exam) or by signing up for a practice session at a test center for a fee.TABLE 1.

This includes both digital and analog watches, cell phones, tablets, and calculators. Examinees are also prohibited from carrying in their books, notes, pens/pencils, and scratch paper (laminated note boards and fine-tip dry erase pens will be provided for use within the testing area). Food and beverages are also prohibited in the testing area. The testing centers are monitored by audio and video surveillance equipment. However, most testing centers allot each examinee a small locker outside the testing area in which he or she can store snacks, beverages, and personal items.\\nQuestions are typically presented in multiple choice format, with 4 or more \\npossible answer options. There is a countdown timer on the lower left corner of the screen as well. There is also a button that allows the examinee to mark a question for review. If a given question happens to be longer than the screen, a scroll bar will appear on the right, allowing the examinee to see the rest of the question. Regardless of whether the examinee clicks on an answer choice or leaves it blank, he or she must click the “Next” button to advance to the next question.\\nThe USMLE features a small number of media clips in the form of audio \\nand/or video. There may even be a question with a multimedia heart sound simulation. In these questions, a digital image of a torso appears on the screen, and the examinee directs a digital stethoscope to various auscultation points to listen for heart and breath sounds. The USMLE orientation materials include several practice questions in these formats. During the exam tutorial, examinees are given an opportunity to ensure that both the audio headphones and the volume are functioning properly. If you are \\nalready familiar with the tutorial and planning on skipping it, first skip ahead to the section where you can test your headphones. After you are sure the headphones are working properly, proceed to the exam.\\nThe examinee can call up a window displaying normal laboratory values. \\nIn order to do so, he or she must click the “Lab” icon on the top part of the screen. Afterward, the examinee will have the option to choose between “Blood,” “Cerebrospinal,” “Hematologic,” or “Sweat and Urine.” The normal values screen may obscure the question if it is expanded. The examinee may have to scroll down to search for the needed lab values. You might want to memorize some common lab values so you spend less time on questions that require you to analyze these.\\nThe CBT interface provides a running list of questions on the left part of the \\nscreen at all times. The software also permits examinees to highlight or cross out information by using their mouse. There is a “Notes” icon on the top part of the screen that allows students to write notes to themselves for review at a later time. Finally, the USMLE has recently added new functionality including text magnification and reverse color (white text on black background). Being familiar with these features can save time and may help you better view and organize the information you need to answer a question. `Keyboard shortcuts: \\n \\x83 A, B, etc—letter choices\\n \\x83 Esc—exit pop-up Calculator and Notes \\nwindows\\n `Be sure to test your headphones during the tutorial. `Heart sounds are tested via media questions.

Students are eligible to register for this three-and-one-half-hour practice session after they have received their scheduling permit.\\nThe same USMLE Step 1 sample test items (120 questions) available \\non the USMLE website are used at these sessions. No new items will be presented. The practice session is available at a cost of $75 ($155 if taken outside of the US and Canada) and is divided into a short tutorial and three 1-hour blocks of ~40 test items each. Students receive a printed percent-correct score after completing the session. No explanations of questions are provided.\\nYou may register for a practice session online at www.usmle.org. A separate \\nscheduling permit is issued for the practice session. Students should allow two weeks for receipt of this permit.\\nHow Do I Register to Take the Exam?\\nPrometric test centers offer Step 1 on a year-round basis, except for the first two weeks in January and major holidays. Check with the test center you want to use before making your exam plans.\\nUS students can apply to take Step 1 at the NBME website. This application \\nallows you to select one of 12 overlapping three-month blocks in which to be tested (eg, April–May–June, June–July–August). Choose your three-month eligibility period wisely. If you need to reschedule outside your initial three-month period, you can request a one-time extension of eligibility for the next contiguous three-month period, and pay a rescheduling fee. The application also includes a photo ID form that must be certified by an official at your medical school to verify your enrollment. After the NBME processes your application, it will send you a scheduling permit.\\nThe scheduling permit you receive from the NBME will contain your USMLE \\nidentification number, the eligibility period in which you may take the exam, and two additional numbers. The first of these is known as your “scheduling number.” You must have this number in order to make your exam appointment with Prometric. The second number is known as the “candidate identification number,” or CIN. Examinees must enter their CINs at the Prometric workstation in order to access their exams. However, you will not be allowed to bring your permit into the exam and will be asked to copy your CIN onto your scratch paper. Prometric has no access to the codes. Make sure to bring a paper or electronic copy of your permit with you to the exam! Also bring an unexpired, government-issued photo ID that includes your signature (such as a  driver’s license or passport). Make sure the name on your photo ID exactly \\nmatches the name that appears on your scheduling permit.\\nOnce you receive your scheduling permit, you may access the Prometric \\nwebsite or call Prometric’s toll-free number to arrange a time to take the  `You can take a shortened CBT practice test at \\na Prometric center.\\n `The Prometric website will display a calendar with open test dates.\\n `Be familiar with Prometric’s policies for cancellation and rescheduling due to COVID-19.\\nFAS1_2024_00_Section_I.indd   5FAS1_2024_00_Section_I.indd   5 1/29/24   1:15 PM1/29/24   1:15 PM'),\n",

You may contact Prometric two weeks before the test date if you \\nwant to confirm identification requirements. Be aware that your exam may be canceled because of circumstances related to COVID-19 or other unforeseen events. If that were to happen, you should receive an email from Prometric containing notice of the cancellation and instructions on rescheduling.\\nAlthough requests for taking the exam may be completed more than six months \\nbefore the test date, examinees will not receive their scheduling permits earlier than six months before the eligibility period. The eligibility period is the three-month period you have chosen to take the exam. Most US medical students attending a school which uses the two-year preclerkship curriculum choose the April–June or June–August period. Most US medical students attending a school which uses the 18-month preclerkship curriculum choose the December–February or January–March period.\\nWhat If I Need to Reschedule the Exam?\\nYou can change your test date and/or center by contacting Prometric at 1-800-MED-EXAM (1-800-633-3926) or www.prometric.com. Make sure to have your CIN when rescheduling. If you are rescheduling by phone, you must speak with a Prometric representative; leaving a voicemail message will not suffice. To avoid a rescheduling fee, you will need to request a change at least 31 calendar days before your appointment. Please note that your rescheduled test date must fall within your assigned three-month eligibility period.\\nWhen Should I Register for the Exam?\\nYou should plan to register as far in advance as possible ahead of your desired test date (eg, six months), but, depending on your particular test center, new dates and times may open closer to the date. Scheduling early will guarantee that you will get either your test center of choice or one within a 50-mile radius of your first choice. For most US medical students, the desired testing window correlates with the end of the preclerkship curriculum, which is around June for schools on a two-year preclerkship schedule, and around January for schools on an 18-month schedule. Thus US medical students should plan to register before January in anticipation of a June test date, or before August in anticipation of a January test date. The timing of the exam is more flexible for IMGs, as it is related only to when they finish exam preparation. Talk with upperclassmen who have already taken the test so you have real-life experience from students who went through a similar curriculum, then formulate your own strategy.\\nWhere Can I Take the Exam?\\nYour testing location is arranged with Prometric when you book your test date (after you receive your scheduling permit).

Examinees will be notified via email when their results are available. By following the online instructions, examinees will be able to view, download, and print their exam report online for ~120 days after notification, after which results can only be obtained through requesting an official USMLE transcript. Additional information about results reporting timetables and accessibility is available on the official USMLE website. Between 2021 and 2022, Step 1 pass rates dropped from 95% to 91% across US/Canadian schools and from 77% to 71% across non-US/Canadian schools (see Table 2), following the transition to pass/fail scoring in January 2022.\\nWhat About Time?\\nTime is of special interest on the CBT exam. Here’s a breakdown of the exam schedule:\\n15 minutes   Tutorial (skip if familiar with test format and features)\\n7 hours  Seven 60-minute question blocks\\n45 minutes Break time (includes time for lunch)\\nThe computer will keep track of how much time has elapsed on the exam. However, the computer will show you only how much time you have remaining in a given block. Therefore, it is up to you to determine if you are pacing yourself properly (at a rate of approximately one question per 90 seconds).\\nThe computer does not warn you if you are spending more than your allotted \\ntime for a break. You should therefore budget your time so that you can take a short break when you need one and have time to eat. You must be especially careful not to spend too much time in between blocks (you should keep track of how much time elapses from the time you finish a block of questions to the time you start the next block). After you finish one question block, you’ll need to click to proceed to the next block of questions. If you do not click within 30\\xa0seconds, you will automatically be entered into a break period.\\nBreak time for the day is 45 minutes, but you are not required to use all of \\nit, nor are you required to use any of it. You can gain extra break time (but not extra time for the question blocks) by skipping the tutorial or by finishing a block ahead of the allotted time. Any time remaining on the clock when you finish a block gets added to your remaining break time. Once a new question block has been started, you may not take a break until you have reached the end of that block. If you do so, this will be recorded as an “unauthorized break” and will be reported on your final exam report. \\nFinally, be aware that it may take a few minutes of your break time to “check \\nout” of the secure resting room and then “check in” again to resume testing, \\nso plan accordingly. The “check-in” process may include fingerprints, pocket checks, and metal detector scanning. Some students recommend pocketless clothing on exam day to streamline the process. `Step 1 pass rates dropped significantly \\namongst both US/Canadian students and IMGs in 2022.\\n `Gain extra break time by skipping the tutorial, or utilize the tutorial time to add personal notes to your scratch paper.\\n `Be careful to watch the clock on your break time.\\nFAS1_2024_00_Section_I.indd   7FAS1_2024_00_Section_I.indd   7 1/29/24   1:15 PM1/29/24   1:15 PM'),\n",

Entering the CIN is the same as breaking the seal on a test book, and you are considered to have started the exam when you do so. However, no result will be reported if you do not complete the exam. If you leave at any time after starting the test, or do not open every block of your test, your test will not be scored and will be reported as incomplete. Incomplete results count toward the maximum of four attempts for each Step exam. Although a pass or fail result is not posted for incomplete tests, examinees may still be offered an option to request that their scores be calculated and reported if they desire; unanswered questions will be scored as incorrect.\\nThe exam ends when all question blocks have been completed or when \\ntheir time has expired. As you leave the testing center, you will receive a printed test-completion notice to document your completion of the exam. To receive an official score, you must finish the entire exam.\\nWhat Types of Questions Are Asked?\\nAll questions on the exam are one-best-answer multiple choice items. Most questions consist of a clinical scenario or a direct question followed by a list of four or more options. You are required to select the single best answer among the options given. There are no “except,” “not,” or matching questions on the exam. A number of options may be partially correct, in which case you must select the option that best answers the question or completes the statement. Additionally, keep in mind that experimental questions may appear on the exam, which do not affect your exam result. `Nearly three fourths of Step 1 questions begin \\nwith a description of a patient.\\nTABLE 2.

Examinees now receive an electronic report that will display the outcome of either “Pass” or “Fail.” Failing reports include a graphic depiction of the distance between the examinee’s score and the minimum passing standard as well as content area feedback. Feedback for the content area shows the examinee’s performance relative to examinees with a low pass (lower, same, or higher) and should be used to guide future study plans. Passing exam reports only displays the outcome of “Pass,” along with a breakdown of topics covered on that individual examination (which will closely mirror the frequencies listed in Table 1). Note that a number of questions are experimental and are not counted toward or against the examinee’s performance.\\nExaminees who took the test before the transition to pass/fail reporting received \\nan electronic report that includes the examinee’s pass/fail status, a three- digit test score, a bar chart comparing the examinee’s performance in each content area with their overall Step 1 performance, and a graphic depiction of the examinee’s performance by physician task, discipline, and organ system. Changes will not be made to transcripts containing three-digit test scores.\\nThe USMLE does not report the minimum number of correct responses \\nneeded to pass, but estimates that it is approximately 60%. The USMLE may update exam result reporting in the future, so please check the USMLE website or www.firstaidteam.com for updates.\\nOfficial NBME/USMLE Resources\\nThe NBME offers a Comprehensive Basic Science Examination (CBSE) for practice that is a shorter version of the Step 1. The CBSE contains four blocks of 50 questions each and covers material that is typically learned during the basic science years. CBSE scores represent the percent of content mastered and show an estimated probability of passing Step 1. Many schools use this test to gauge whether a student is expected to pass Step 1. If this test is offered by your school, it is usually conducted at the end of regular didactic time before any dedicated Step 1 preparation. If you do not encounter the CBSE before your dedicated study time, you need not worry about taking it. Use the information to help set realistic goals and timetables for your success. \\nThe NBME also offers six forms of Comprehensive Basic Science Self-\\nAssessment (CBSSA). Students who prepared for the exam using this web-based tool reported that they found the format and content highly indicative of questions tested on the actual exam. In addition, the CBSSA is a fair predictor of historical USMLE performance. The test interface, however, does not match the actual USMLE test interface, so practicing with these forms alone is not advised.\\nThe CBSSA exists in two formats: standard-paced and self-paced, both of \\nwhich consist of four sections of 50 questions each (for a total of 200 multiple choice items). The standard-paced format allows the user up to 75 minutes  `Depending on the resource used, practice \\nquestions may be easier than the actual exam.\\nFAS1_2024_00_Section_I.indd   9FAS1_2024_00_Section_I.indd   9 1/29/24   1:15 PM1/29/24   1:15 PM'),\n",

Every few years, new forms are released and older ones are retired, reflecting changes in exam content. Therefore, the newer exams tend to be more similar to the actual Step 1, and scores from these exams tend to provide a better estimation of exam day performance. \\nKeep in mind that this bank of questions is available only on the web. The \\nNBME requires that users start and complete the exam within 90 days of purchase. Once the assessment has begun, users are required to complete the sections within 20 days. Following completion of the questions, the CBSSA provides a performance profile indicating the user’s relative strengths and weaknesses, much like the report profile for the USMLE Step 1 exam. In addition to the performance profile, examinees will be informed of the number of questions answered incorrectly. You will have the ability to review the text of all questions with detailed explanations. The NBME charges $60 for each assessment, payable by credit card or money order. For more information regarding the CBSE and the CBSSA, visit the NBME’s website at www.nbme.org.\\nThe NBME scoring system is weighted for each assessment exam. While \\nsome exams seem more difficult than others, the equated percent correct reported takes into account these inter-test differences. Also, while many students report seeing Step 1 questions “word-for-word” out of the assessments, the NBME makes special note that no live USMLE questions are shown on any NBME assessment.\\nLastly, the International Foundations of Medicine (IFOM) offers a Basic \\nScience Examination (BSE) practice exam at participating Prometric test centers for $200. Students may also take the self-assessment test online for $35 through the NBME’s website. The IFOM BSE is intended to determine an examinee’s relative areas of strength and weakness in general areas of basic science—not to predict performance on the USMLE Step 1 exam—and the content covered by the two examinations is somewhat different. However, because there is substantial overlap in content coverage and many IFOM items were previously used on the USMLE Step 1, it is possible to roughly project IFOM performance onto the historical USMLE Step 1 score scale. More information is available at http://www.nbme.org/ifom/.\\n\\u2009`LEARNING STRATEGIES\\nMany students feel overwhelmed during the preclinical years and struggle to find an effective learning strategy. Table 3 lists several learning strategies you can try and their estimated effectiveness for Step 1 preparation based on the literature (see References). These are merely suggestions, and it’s important to take your learning preferences into account. Your comprehensive learning approach will contain a combination of strategies (eg, elaborative interrogation followed by practice testing, mnemonics review using spaced \\nFAS1_2024_00_Section_I.indd   10FAS1_2024_00_Section_I.indd   10 1/29/24   1:15 PM1/29/24   1:15 PM'),\n",

Regardless of your choice, the foundation of knowledge \\nyou build during your basic science years is the most important resource for success on the USMLE Step 1. \\nHIGH EFFICACY\\nPractice Testing\\nAlso called “retrieval practice,” practice testing has both direct and indirect benefits to the learner.\\n4 Effortful retrieval of answers does not only identify \\nweak spots—it directly strengthens long-term retention of material.5 The \\nmore effortful the recall, the better the long-term retention. This advantage has been shown to result in higher test scores and GPAs.\\n6 In fact, research \\nhas shown a positive correlation between the number of boards-style practice questions completed and Step 1 performance among medical students.\\n7\\nPractice testing should be done with “interleaving” (mixing of questions from different topics in a single session).

Practicing \\ntopics in massed fashion (eg, all cardiology, then all dermatology) may seem intuitive, but there is strong evidence that interleaving correlates with longer-term retention and increased student achievement, especially on tasks that involve problem solving.\\n5 \\nIn addition to using question banks, you can test yourself by arranging your notes in a question-answer format (eg, via flash cards). Testing these Q&As in random order allows you to reap the benefit of interleaved practice. Bear in mind that the utility of practice testing comes from the practice of information retrieval, so simply reading through Q&As will attenuate this benefit.\\nDistributed Practice\\nAlso called “spaced repetition,” distributed practice is the opposite of massed practice or “cramming.” Learners review material at increasingly spaced out intervals (days to weeks to months). Massed learning may produce more short-term gains and satisfaction, but learners who use distributed practice have better mastery and retention over the long term.\\n5,9\\nFlash cards are a simple way to incorporate both distributed practice and practice testing. Studies have linked spaced repetition learning with flash cards to improved long-term knowledge retention and higher exam scores.\\n6,8,10 \\nApps with automated spaced-repetition software (SRS) for flash cards exist for smartphones and tablets, so the cards are accessible anywhere. Proceed with caution: there is an art to making and reviewing cards. The ease of quickly downloading or creating digital cards can lead to flash card overload (it is unsustainable to make 50 flash cards per lecture!). Even at a modest pace, the thousands upon thousands of cards are too overwhelming for Step 1 preparation. Unless you have specific high-yield cards (and have checked the content with high-yield resources), stick to pre-made cards by reputable sources that curate the vast amount of knowledge for you. \\nIf you prefer pen and paper, consider using a planner or spreadsheet to \\norganize your study material over time. Distributed practice allows for some forgetting of information, and the added effort of recall over time strengthens the learning.\\nMODERATE EFFICACY\\nMnemonics\\nA “mnemonic” refers to any device that assists memory, such as acronyms, mental imagery (eg, keywords with or without memory palaces), etc. Keyword mnemonics have been shown to produce superior knowledge retention when compared with rote memorization in many scenarios. However, they are generally more effective when applied to memorization-heavy, keyword-friendly topics and may not be broadly suitable.\\n5  Keyword mnemonics may \\nnot produce long-term retention, so consider combining mnemonics with distributed, retrieval-based practice (eg, via flash cards with SRS). `Studies have linked spaced repetition \\nlearning with flash cards to improved long-term knowledge retention and higher exam scores.\\nFAS1_2024_00_Section_I.indd   12FAS1_2024_00_Section_I.indd   12 1/29/24   1:15 PM1/29/24   1:15 PM'),\n",

If you can create your own mnemonic that accurately represents the material, this will be more memorable. When topics are complex and accurate mnemonics are challenging to create, pre-made mnemonics may be more effective, especially if you are inexperienced at creating mnemonics.\\n11\\nElaborative Interrogation/Self-Explanation\\nElaborative interrogation (“why” questions) and self-explanation (general questioning) prompt learners to generate explanations for facts. When reading passages of discrete facts, consider using these techniques, which have been shown to be more effective than rereading (eg, improved recall and better problem-solving/diagnostic performance).\\n5,12,13\\nConcept Mapping\\nConcept mapping is a method for graphically organizing knowledge, with concepts enclosed in boxes and lines drawn between related concepts. Creating or studying concept maps may be more effective than other activities (eg, writing or reading summaries/outlines). However, studies have reached mixed conclusions about its utility, and the small size of this effect raises doubts about its authenticity and pedagogic significance.\\n14\\nLOW EFFICACY\\nRereading\\nWhile the most commonly used method among surveyed students, rereading has not been shown to correlate with grade point average.\\n9 Due to \\nits popularity, rereading is often a comparator in studies on learning. Other strategies that we have discussed (eg, practice testing) have been shown to be significantly more effective than rereading.\\nHighlighting/Underlining\\nBecause this method is passive, it tends to be of minimal value for learning and recall. In fact, lower-performing students are more likely to use these techniques.\\n9 Students who highlight and underline do not learn how \\nto actively recall learned information and thus find it difficult to apply knowledge to exam questions.\\nSummarization\\nWhile more useful for improving performance on generative measures (eg, free recall or essays), summarization is less useful for exams that depend on recognition (eg, multiple choice). Findings on the overall efficacy of this method have been mixed.\\n5 `Elaborative interrogation and self-\\nexplanation prompt learners to generate explanations for facts, which improves recall and problem solving.\\nFAS1_2024_00_Section_I.indd   13FAS1_2024_00_Section_I.indd   13 1/29/24   1:15 PM1/29/24   1:15 PM'),\n",

Determine whether you want to spread out your study time or concentrate it into 10-hour study days in the final weeks. Then factor in your own history in preparing for standardized examinations (eg, SAT, MCAT). Talk to students at your school who have recently taken Step 1. Ask them for their study schedules, especially those who have study habits and goals similar to yours. Sample schedules can be found at https://firstaidteam.com/schedules/. \\nTypically, US medical schools allot between four and eight weeks for \\ndedicated Step 1 preparation. The time you dedicate to exam preparation will depend on your confidence in comfortably achieving a passing score as well as your success in preparing yourself during the first two years of medical school. Some students reserve about a week at the end of their study period for final review; others save just a few days. When you have scheduled your exam date, do your best to adhere to it.\\n \\nMake your schedule realistic, and set achievable goals. Many students make the mistake of studying at a level of detail that requires too much time for a comprehensive review—reading Gray’s Anatomy in a couple of days is not a realistic goal! Have one catch-up day per week of studying. No matter how well you stick to your schedule, unexpected events happen. But don’t let yourself procrastinate because you have catch-up days; stick to your schedule as closely as possible and revise it regularly on the basis of your actual progress. Be careful not to lose focus. Beware of feelings of inadequacy when comparing study schedules and progress with your peers. Avoid others who stress you out. Focus on a few top-rated resources that suit your learning style—not on some obscure resource your friends may pass down to you. Accept the fact that you cannot learn it all.\\nYou will need time for uninterrupted and focused study. Plan your \\npersonal affairs to minimize crisis situations near the date of the test. Allot an adequate number of breaks in your study schedule to avoid burnout. Maintain a healthy lifestyle with proper diet, exercise, and sleep.\\nAnother important aspect of your preparation is your studying environment. \\nStudy where you have always been comfortable studying. Be sure to include everything you need close by (review books, notes, coffee, snacks,  `Customize your schedule. T ackle your weakest \\nsection first.\\n `Avoid burnout.

If you’re the kind of person who cannot study alone, form a study group \\nwith other students taking the exam. The main point here is to create a comfortable environment with minimal distractions.\\nY ear(s) Prior\\nThe knowledge you gained during your first two years of medical school and even during your undergraduate years should provide the groundwork on which to base your test preparation. Student scores on NBME subject tests (commonly known as “shelf exams”) have been shown to be highly correlated with subsequent Step 1 performance.\\n15 Moreover, undergraduate science \\nGPAs as well as MCAT scores are strong predictors of performance on the Step 1 exam.\\n16 \\nWe also recommend that you buy highly rated review books early in your first year of medical school and use them as you study throughout the two years. When Step 1 comes along, these books will be familiar and personalized to the way in which you learn. It is risky and intimidating to use unfamiliar review books in the final two or three weeks preceding the exam. Some students find it helpful to personalize and annotate First Aid throughout the curriculum.\\nMonths Prior\\nReview test dates and the application procedure. Testing for the USMLE Step 1 is done on a year-round basis. If you have disabilities or special cir-cumstances, contact the NBME as early as possible to discuss test accommo-dations (see the Section I Supplement at www.firstaidteam.com/bonus).\\nUse this time to finalize your ideal schedule. Consider upcoming breaks \\nand whether you want to relax or study. Work backward from your test date to make sure you finish at least one question bank. Also add time to redo missed or flagged questions (which may be half the bank). This is the time to build a structured plan with enough flexibility for the realities of life.\\nBegin doing blocks of questions from reputable question banks under “real” \\nconditions. Don’t use tutor mode until you’re sure you can finish blocks in the allotted time. It is important to continue balancing success in your normal studies with the Step 1 test preparation process.\\nWeeks Prior (Dedicated Preparation)\\nYour dedicated prep time may be one week or two months. You should have a working plan as you go into this period. Finish your schoolwork strong, take a day off, and then get to work. Start by simulating a full-length USMLE Step 1 if you haven’t yet done so. Consider doing one NBME CBSSA and the free questions from the NBME website. Alternatively, you could choose 7 blocks of randomized questions from a commercial question bank. Make sure you get feedback on your strengths and weaknesses and adjust your studying accordingly. Many students study from review sources or comprehensive  `Buy review resources early (first year) and use \\nwhile studying for courses.\\n `Simulate the USMLE Step 1 under “real” conditions before beginning your studies.\\nFAS1_2024_00_Section_I.indd   15FAS1_2024_00_Section_I.indd   15 1/29/24   1:15 PM1/29/24   1:15 PM'),\n",

Also, keep in mind that \\nreviewing a question block can take upward of two hours. Feedback from CBSSA exams and question banks will help you focus on your weaknesses.\\nOne Week Prior\\nMake sure you have your CIN (found on your scheduling permit) as well as other items necessary for the day of the examination, including a current driver’s license or another form of photo ID with your signature (make sure the name on your ID exactly matches that on your scheduling permit). Confirm the Prometric testing center location and test time. Work out how you will get to the testing center and what parking, traffic, and public transportation problems you might encounter. Exchange cell phone numbers with other students taking the test on the same day in case of emergencies. Check www.prometric.com/closures for test site closures due to unforeseen events. Determine what you will do for lunch. Make sure you have everything you need to ensure that you will be comfortable and alert at the test site. It may be beneficial to adjust your schedule to start waking up at the same time that you will on your test day. And of course, make sure to maintain a healthy lifestyle and get enough sleep. \\nOne Day Prior\\nTry your best to relax and rest the night before the test. Double-check your admissions and test-taking materials as well as the comfort measures discussed earlier so that you will not have to deal with such details on the morning of the exam. At this point it will be more effective to review short-term memory material that you’re already familiar with than to try to learn new material. The Rapid Review section at the end of this book is high yield for last-minute studying. Remember that regardless of how hard you have studied, you cannot (and need not!) know everything. There will be things on the exam that you have never even seen before, so do not panic. Do not underestimate your abilities. \\nMany students report difficulty sleeping the night prior to the exam. This is \\noften exacerbated by going to bed much earlier than usual. Do whatever it takes to ensure a good night’s sleep (eg, massage, exercise, warm milk, no screens at night). Do not change your daily routine prior to the exam. Exam day is not the day for a caffeine-withdrawal headache.\\nMorning of the Exam\\nOn the morning of the Step 1 exam, wake up at your regular time and eat a normal breakfast. If you think it will help you, have a close friend or family member check to make sure you get out of bed. Make sure you have your scheduling permit admission ticket, test-taking materials, and comfort measures as discussed earlier. Wear loose, comfortable clothing. Limiting the number of pockets in your outfit may save time during security screening. Plan for a variable temperature in the testing center. Arrive at the test site 30  `In the final two weeks, focus on review, \\npractice questions, and endurance.

When you arrive at the test site, the proctor should give you a USMLE information sheet that will explain critical factors such as the proper use of break time. Seating may be assigned, but ask to be reseated if necessary; you need to be seated in an area that will allow you to remain comfortable and to concentrate. Get to know your testing station, especially if you have never been in a Prometric testing center before. Listen to your proctors regarding any changes in instructions or testing procedures that may apply to your test site.\\nIf you are experiencing symptoms of illness on the day of your exam, we \\nstrongly recommend you reschedule. If you become ill or show signs of illness (eg, persistent cough) during the exam, the test center may prohibit you from completing the exam due to health and safety risks for test center staff and other examinees.\\nFinally, remember that it is natural (and even beneficial) to be a little \\nnervous. Focus on being mentally clear and alert. Avoid panic. When you are asked to begin the exam, take a deep breath, focus on the screen, and then begin. Keep an eye on the timer. Take advantage of breaks between blocks to stretch, maybe do some jumping jacks, and relax for a moment with deep breathing or stretching.\\nAfter the Test\\nAfter you have completed the exam, be sure to have fun and relax regardless of how you may feel. Taking the test is an achievement in itself. Remember, you are much more likely to have passed than not. Enjoy the free time you have before your clerkships. Expect to experience some “reentry” phenomena as you try to regain a real life. Once you have recovered sufficiently from the test (or from partying), we invite you to send us your feedback, corrections, and suggestions for entries, facts, mnemonics, strategies, resource ratings, and the like (see p. xvii, How to Contribute). Sharing your experience will benefit fellow medical students.\\n\\u2009`STUDY MATERIALS\\nQuality Considerations\\nAlthough an ever-increasing number of review books and software are now available on the market, the quality of such material is highly variable. Some common problems are as follows:\\n \\x83Certain review books are too detailed to allow for review in a reasonable amount of time or cover subtopics that are not emphasized on the exam.\\n \\x83 Many sample question books were originally written years ago and have not been adequately updated to reflect recent trends.\\n \\x83Some question banks test to a level of detail that you will not find on the exam. `Arrive at the testing center 30 minutes before \\nyour scheduled exam time. If you arrive more than half an hour late, you will not be allowed to take the test.\\nFAS1_2024_00_Section_I.indd   17FAS1_2024_00_Section_I.indd   17 1/29/24   1:15 PM1/29/24   1:15 PM'),\n",

You are investing not only money but also your limited study time. Do not worry about finding the “perfect” book, as many subjects simply do not have one, and different students prefer different formats. Supplement your chosen books with personal notes from other sources, including what you learn from question banks.\\nThere are two types of review books: those that are stand-alone titles and \\nthose that are part of a series. Books in a series generally have the same style, and you must decide if that style works for you. However, a given style is not optimal for every subject.\\nYou should also find out which books are up to date. Some recent editions \\nreflect major improvements, whereas others contain only cursory changes. Take into consideration how a book reflects the format of the USMLE Step 1. \\nApps\\nWith the explosion of smartphones and tablets, apps are an increasingly popular way to review for the Step 1 exam. The majority of apps are compatible with both iOS and Android. Many popular Step 1 review resources (eg, UWorld, USMLE-Rx) have apps that are compatible with their software. Many popular web references (eg, UpToDate) also now offer app versions. All of these apps offer flexibility, allowing you to study while away from a computer (eg, while traveling).\\nPractice Tests\\nTaking practice tests provides valuable information about potential strengths and weaknesses in your fund of knowledge and test-taking skills. Some students use practice examinations simply as a means of breaking up the monotony of studying and adding variety to their study schedule, whereas other students rely almost solely on practice. You should also subscribe to one or more high-quality question banks. \\nAdditionally, some students preparing for the Step 1 exam have started to \\nincorporate case-based books intended primarily for clinical students on the wards or studying for the Step 2 CK exam. First Aid Cases for the USMLE Step 1 aims to directly address this need.\\nAfter taking a practice test, spend time on each question and each answer \\nchoice whether you were right or wrong. There are important teaching points in each explanation. Knowing why a wrong answer choice is incorrect is just as important as knowing why the right answer is correct. Do not panic if your practice scores are low as many questions try to trick or distract you to highlight a certain point. Use the questions you missed or were unsure about to develop focused plans during your scheduled catch-up time. `If a given review book is not working for you, \\nstop using it no matter how highly rated it may be or how much it costs.\\n `Charts and diagrams may be the best approach for physiology and biochemistry, whereas tables and outlines may be preferable for microbiology.\\n `Most practice exams are shorter and less clinical than the real thing.\\n `Use practice tests to identify concepts and areas of weakness, not just facts that you missed.\\nFAS1_2024_00_Section_I.indd   18FAS1_2024_00_Section_I.indd   18 1/29/24   1:15 PM1/29/24   1:15 PM'),\n",

Many \\ntextbooks are too detailed for high-yield review and include material that is generally not tested on the USMLE Step 1 (eg, drug dosages, complex chemical structures). Syllabi, although familiar, are inconsistent across medical schools and frequently reflect the emphasis of individual faculty, which often does not correspond to that of the USMLE Step 1. Syllabi also tend to be less organized than top-rated books and generally contain fewer diagrams and study questions.\\nIntegration of AI in Medical Education: Transforming USMLE Preparation\\nThe integration of AI into education signals a paradigm shift in the acquisition and application of medical knowledge. AI’s increasing ability to process extensive data sets and adapt to various learning styles makes it an attractive tool in medical training and practice.\\n17 Studies have demonstrated \\nthat AI language models are capable of achieving high accuracy rates when answering USMLE-style questions, underscoring its potential in supporting medical education.\\n18\\nAlthough undeniably powerful, effectively utilizing AI as a study tool requires both practice and individual trial and error. We suggest the following approaches and prompts that might help learners more effectively harness AI for exam preparation:\\nTailored Mnemonic Creation: Devise unique mnemonics to aid in \\nmemorizing complex medical terms efficiently. AI models can be highly creative in generating new ones, although feedback and iteration will likely be needed to produce mnemonics that are both accurate and memorable.\\nExample prompt: Create a food-related mnemonic for remembering \\nadverse effects 1, 2, and 3 of Drug A.\\nCustom Summarization of Medical Texts: Efficiently condense extensive \\nmedical literature into concise summaries, facilitating efficient and rapid topic reviews.\\nExample prompt: Summarize this medical school lecture into bullet \\npoints. Decrease length by 80%.\\nAI-Generated Custom Quizzes: Create focused practice questions.\\nExample Prompt: Create three vignette-style multiple choice questions \\ntesting presentations of lysosomal storage disorders.Clinical Case Simulations: Utilize AI-powered simulations of realistic \\nclinical scenarios to practice decision-making skills and application of medical knowledge.\\nExample prompt: Create an exercise to practice analyzing acid-base \\ndisorders requiring Winter’s formula with step-by-step explanations.\\nFAS1_2024_00_Section_I.indd   19FAS1_2024_00_Section_I.indd   19 1/29/24   1:15 PM1/29/24   1:15 PM'),\n",

Modify schedules daily based on progress.\\nExample prompt: Prepare a schedule to review this book over 4 weeks.\\nThough both exciting and promising, pitfalls of using AI models for studying include the potential for outdated information or reliance on data that are not validated, resulting in a potential source of misinformation. AI can become unintentionally trained with human biases, and thus produce results that further reinforce or perpetuate potentially harmful biases. When using AI for personal studying, always validate information and maintain a critical eye when creating prompts.\\nAI is clearly a rapidly evolving study tool, however, how it can be best \\nintegrated with proven study methods remains to be seen. For the most recent updates on effectively leveraging AI in medical education, we encourage you to explore our blog at firstaidteam.com and scan a variety of student-centered discussion forums.\\n\\u2009`TEST-TAKING STRATEGIES\\nYour test performance will be influenced by both your knowledge and your test-taking skills. You can strengthen your performance by considering each of these factors. Test-taking skills and strategies should be developed and perfected well in advance of the test date so that you can concentrate on the test itself. We suggest that you try the following strategies to see if they might work for you.\\nPacing\\nYou have seven hours to complete up to 280 questions. Note that each one-hour block contains up to 40 questions. This works out to approximately 90\\xa0seconds per question. We recommend following the “1 minute rule” to pace yourself. Spend no more than 1 minute on each question. If you are still unsure about the answer after this time, mark the question, make an educated guess, and move on. Following this rule, you should have approximately 20\\xa0minutes left after all questions are answered, which you can use to revisit all of your marked questions. Remember that some questions may be experimental and do not count for points (and reassure yourself that these experimental questions are the ones that are stumping you). In the past, pacing errors have been detrimental to the performance of even highly prepared examinees. The bottom line is to keep one eye on the clock at all times! `Practice! Develop your test-taking skills and \\nstrategies well before the test date.\\n `Time management is an important skill for exam success.\\nFAS1_2024_00_Section_I.indd   20FAS1_2024_00_Section_I.indd   20 1/29/24   1:15 PM1/29/24   1:15 PM'),\n",

One technique begins with identifying each question as easy, workable, or impossible. Your goal should be to answer all easy questions, resolve all workable questions in a reasonable amount of time, and make quick and intelligent guesses on all impossible questions. Most students read the stem, think of the answer, and turn immediately to the choices. A second technique is to first skim the answer choices to get a context, then read the last sentence of the question (the lead-in), and then read through the passage quickly, extracting only information relevant to answering the question. This can be particularly helpful for questions with long clinical vignettes. Try a variety of techniques on practice exams and see what works best for you. If you get overwhelmed, remember that a 30-second time out to refocus may get you back on track.\\nGuessing\\nThere is no penalty for wrong answers. Thus no test block should be left with unanswered questions. If you don’t know the answer, first eliminate incorrect choices, then guess among the remaining options. Note that dozens of questions are unscored experimental questions meant to obtain statistics for future exams. Therefore, some questions may seem unusual or unreasonably difficult simply because they are part of the development process for future exams.\\nChanging Y our Answer\\nThe conventional wisdom is not to second-guess your initial answers. However, studies have consistently shown that test takers are more likely to change from a wrong answer to the correct answer than the other way around. Many question banks tell you how many questions you changed from right to wrong, wrong to wrong, and wrong to right. Use this feedback to judge how good a second-guesser you are. If you have extra time, reread the question stem and make sure you didn’t misinterpret the question.\\n\\u2009`CLINICAL VIGNETTE STRATEGIES\\nIn recent years, the USMLE Step 1 has become increasingly clinically oriented. This change mirrors the trend in medical education toward introducing students to clinical problem solving during the basic science years. The increasing clinical emphasis on Step 1 may be challenging to those students who attend schools with a more traditional curriculum. `Go with your first hunch, unless you are \\ncertain that you are a good second-guesser.\\n `Be prepared to read fast and think on your feet!\\nFAS1_2024_00_Section_I.indd   21FAS1_2024_00_Section_I.indd   21 1/29/24   1:15 PM1/29/24   1:15 PM'),\n",

Sometimes this paragraph is followed by a brief listing of important physical findings and/or laboratory results. The task of assimilating all this information and answering the associated question in the span of one minute can be intimidating. So be prepared to read quickly and think on your feet. Remember that the question is often indirectly asking something you already know.\\nA pseudovignette is a question that includes a description of a case similar to \\nthat of a clinical vignette, but it ends with a declarative recall question; thus the material presented in the pseudovignette is not necessary to answer the question. Question writers strive to avoid pseudovignettes on the USMLE Step 1. Be prepared to tackle each vignette as if the information presented is important to answer the associated question correctly.\\nStrategy\\nRemember that Step 1 vignettes usually describe diseases or disorders in their most classic presentation. So look for cardinal signs (eg, malar rash for lupus or nuchal rigidity for meningitis) in the narrative history. Be aware that the question will contain classic signs and symptoms instead of buzzwords. Sometimes the data from labs and the physical exam will help you confirm or reject possible diagnoses, thereby helping you rule answer choices in or out. In some cases, they will be a dead giveaway for the diagnosis.\\nMaking a diagnosis from the history and data is often not the final answer. Not \\ninfrequently, the diagnosis is divulged at the end of the vignette, after you have just struggled through the narrative to come up with a diagnosis of your own. The question might then ask about a related aspect of the diagnosed disease. Consider skimming the answer choices and lead-in before diving into a long stem. However, be careful with skimming the answer choices; going too fast may warp your perception of what the vignette is asking.\\n\\u2009`IF YOU THINK YOU FAILED\\nAfter taking the test, it is normal for many examinees to feel unsure about their performance, despite the majority of them achieving a passing score. Historical pass data are in Table 2. If you remain quite concerned, it may be wise to prepare a course of action should you need to retest. There are several sensible steps you can take to plan for the future in the event that you do not achieve a passing score. First, save and organize all your study materials, including review books, practice tests, and notes. Familiarize yourself with the reapplication procedures for Step 1, including application deadlines and upcoming test dates.  `Practice questions that include case histories \\nor descriptive vignettes are critical for Step 1 preparation.\\n `Step 1 vignettes usually describe diseases or disorders in their most classic presentation.\\nFAS1_2024_00_Section_I.indd   22FAS1_2024_00_Section_I.indd   22 1/29/24   1:15 PM1/29/24   1:15 PM'),\n",

The total number of attempts an examinee may take per Step examination is four.\\n18 You may take Step 1 no more than three times within \\na 12-month period. Your fourth attempt must be at least 12 months after your first attempt at that exam, and at least 6 months after your most recent attempt at that exam. \\nIf you failed, the performance profiles in your score report provide \\nvaluable feedback concerning your relative strengths and weaknesses. Study these profiles closely. Set up a study timeline to strengthen gaps in your knowledge as well as to maintain and improve what you already know. Do not neglect high-yield subjects.

The information is presented in a partially organ-based format. Hence, Section II is devoted to the foundational principles of biochemistry, microbiology, immunology, basic pathology, basic pharmacology, and public health sciences. Section III focuses on organ systems, with subsections covering the embryology, anatomy and histology, physiology, clinical pathology, and clinical pharmacology relevant to each. Each subsection is then divided into smaller topic areas containing related facts. Individual facts are generally presented in a three-column format, with the Title of the fact in \\nthe first column, the Description of the fact in the second column, and the \\nMnemonic or Special Note in the third column. Some facts do not have a \\nmnemonic and are presented in a two-column format. Others are presented in list or tabular form in order to emphasize key associations. \\nThe database structure used in Sections II and III is useful for reviewing \\nmaterial already learned. These sections are not ideal for learning complex or highly conceptual material for the first time.\\nThe database of high-yield facts is not comprehensive. Use it to complement \\nyour core study mate rial and not as your primary study source. The facts and \\nnotes have been condensed and edited to emphasize the high-yield material, and as a result, each entry is “incomplete” and arguably “over-simplified.” Often, the more you research a topic, the more complex it becomes, with certain topics resisting simplification. Determine your most efficient methods for learning the material, and do not be afraid to abandon a strategy if it is not working for you.\\nOur database of high-yield facts is updated annually to keep current with \\nnew trends in boards emphasis, including clinical relevance. However, we must note that inevitably many other high-yield topics are not yet included in our database.\\nWe actively encourage medical students and faculty to submit high-yield \\ntopics, well-written entries, diagrams, clinical images, and useful mnemonics so that we may enhance the database for future students. We also solicit recommendations of alternate tools for study that may be useful in preparing for the examination, such as charts, flash cards, apps, and online resources (see How to Contribute, p. xv).SECTION II HIGH-YIELD GENERAL PRINCIPLES HIGH-YIELD GENERAL PRINCIPLES 28\\nFAS1_2024_01-Biochem.indd   28FAS1_2024_01-Biochem.indd   28 1/29/24   3:23 PM1/29/24   3:23 PM'),\n",

When studying metabolic pathways, emphasize important regulatory steps and enzyme deficiencies that result in disease, as well as reactions targeted by pharmacologic interventions. For example, understanding the defect in Lesch-Nyhan syndrome and its clinical consequences is higher yield than memorizing every intermediate in the purine salvage pathway.\\nDo not spend time learning details of organic chemistry, mechanisms, or \\nphysical chemistry. Detailed chemical structures are infrequently tested; however, many structures have been included here to help students learn reactions and the important enzymes involved. Familiarity with the biochemical techniques that have medical relevance—such as ELISA, immunoelectrophoresis, Southern blotting, and PCR—is useful.

For example, a description of a child with fever and a petechial rash will be followed by a question that reads, “From what site does the responsible organism usually enter the blood?”\\nThis section therefore presents organisms in two major ways: in \\nindividual microbial “profiles” and in the context of the systems they infect and the clinical presentations they produce. You should become familiar with both formats. When reviewing the systems approach, remind yourself of the features of each microbe by returning to the individual profiles.

I am not engaged in therapeutics, but in pathology.”\\n—H.L. Mencken\\nThe fundamental principles of pathology are key to understanding diseases in all organ systems. Major topics such as inflammation and neoplasia appear frequently in questions across different organ systems, and such topics are definitely high yield. For example, the concepts of cell injury and inflammation are key to understanding the inflammatory response that follows myocardial infarction, a very common subject of board questions. Similarly, a familiarity with the early cellular changes that culminate in the development of neoplasias—for example, esophageal or colon cancer—is critical. Make sure you recognize the major tumor-associated genes and are comfortable with key cancer concepts such as tumor staging and metastasis. Finally, take some time to learn about the major systemic changes that come with aging, and how these physiologic alterations differ from disease states.PathologyHIGH-YIELD PRINCIPLES IN\\nSECTION II\\nDO not delete, used for running headers\\nFAS1_2024_04-Pathol.indd   201FAS1_2024_04-Pathol.indd   201 1/29/24   4:36 PM1/29/24   4:36 PM'),\n",

One major recent change is that the USMLE Step 1 has moved away from testing pharmacotherapeutics. That means you will generally not be required to identify medications indicated for a specific condition. You still need to know mechanisms and important adverse effects of key drugs and their major variants. Obscure derivatives are low-yield. Learn their classic and distinguishing toxicities as well as major drug-drug interactions. \\nReviewing associated biochemistry, physiology, and microbiology \\nconcepts can be useful while studying pharmacology. The exam has a strong emphasis on ANS, CNS, antimicrobial, and cardiovascular agents as well as on NSAIDs, which are covered throughout the text. Specific drug dosages or trade names are generally not testable. The exam may use graphs to test various pharmacology content, so make sure you are comfortable interpreting them.PharmacologySECTION II\\nDO not delete, used for running headers\\nFAS1_2024_05-Pharmacology.indd   227FAS1_2024_05-Pharmacology.indd   227 1/30/24   10:37 AM1/30/24   10:37 AM'),\n",

Biostatistics and epidemiology are the foundations of evidence-based medicine and are very high yield. Make sure you can quickly apply biostatistical equations such as sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values in a problem-solving format. Also, know how to set up your own 2 × 2 tables, and beware questions that switch the columns. Quality improvement and patient safety topics were introduced a few years ago on the exam and represent trends in health system science. Medical ethics questions often require application of principles. Typically, you are presented with a patient scenario and then asked how you would respond. In this edition, we provide further details on communication skills and patient care given their growing emphasis on the exam. Effective communication is essential to the physician-patient partnership. Physicians must seek opportunities to connect with patients, understand their perspectives, express empathy, and form shared decisions and realistic goals.Public Health Sciences\\nFAS1_2024_06-PubHealth.indd   255FAS1_2024_06-PubHealth.indd   255 1/31/24   8:12 AM1/31/24   8:12 AM'),\n",

However, information \\nabout patient preferences may be absent at the time patients require this intervention to survive. \\nMedical decision-making frequently relies on surrogate decision-makers (patient identified or \\nlegally appointed) when discussing the continuation or withdrawal of ventilatory support, focusing on both the prognosis of the condition and the believed wishes of the patient. \\nIf surrogates indicate patient would not have wanted to receive life support with ventilation \\x8e \\nwithhold or withdraw life support regardless of what the surrogate prefers.\\nIf the decision is made to withhold or withdraw life support, involve palliative care, chaplain services, \\nand the primary care physician in medical discussions with the family and provide emotional support.\\nSurrogate decision-makerIf a patient loses decision-making capacity and has not prepared an advance directive, individuals \\n(surrogates) who know the patient must determine what the patient would have done.

If the patient is incapacitated or the \\nsituation is emergent, disclosing information to family and friends should be guided by professional judgment of patient’s best interest.

Dangerous communicable diseases, such as TB or Ebola, may require involuntary treatment.\\nAccepting gifts from patientsA complex subject without definitive regulations. Some argue that the patient-physician \\nrelationship is strengthened through accepting a gift from a patient, while others argue that negative consequences outweigh the benefits of accepting any gift.\\nIn practice, patients often present items such as cards, baked goods, and inexpensive gifts to \\nphysicians. The physician’s decision to accept or decline is based on an individual assessment of whether or not the risk of harm outweighs the potential benefit.\\n \\x83Physicians should not accept gifts that are inappropriately large or valuable.\\n \\x83Gifts should not be accepted if the physician identifies that the gift could detrimentally affect patient care.\\n \\x83Gifts that may cause emotional or financial stress for the patient should not be accepted.\\nIf a gift violates any of the guidelines above, the best practice is to thank the patient for offering \\na kind gift, but politely indicate that it must be declined. During this conversation it should be emphasized that the incident does not influence the physician-patient relationship in any way.\\nFAS1_2024_06-PubHealth.indd   269FAS1_2024_06-PubHealth.indd   269 1/31/24   8:12 AM1/31/24   8:12 AM'),\n",

A patient’s assigned sex at birth and gender identity may differ. Do not bring up gender or sexuality if it is not relevant to the visit (eg, a gender-nonconforming patient seeking care for a hand laceration).\\nConsider stating what pronouns you use when you introduce yourself (eg, “I’m Dr. Smith, and I use she/\\nher pronouns”) and asking patients how they would like to be addressed. Also consider ways of being inclusive (eg, ensuring correct name and pronouns are in the EMR).\\nReassure them about the confidentiality of their visits and be sensitive to the fact that patients may \\nnot be open about their sexual orientation or gender identity to others in their life.\\nRemember: trust is built over time, and listening to and learning from patients about how they \\nwould like to approach the topics discussed above is key.\\nCultural formulation interviewIdentify the problem through the patient’s perspective. Ask the patient to describe the problem in \\ntheir own words, or how the patient would describe the problem to their family and friends.\\nIdentify cultural perceptions of factors leading to a problem. Ask the patient to explain why they \\nthink they are experiencing their problem.\\nIdentify how the patient’s background influences their problem. Ask the patient about what makes \\ntheir problem better or worse. Investigate roles of family, community, and spirituality.\\nIdentify how culture may impact current and future interventions. Ask the patient if they have any \\nconcerns or suggestions about the current plan of treatment. If they do not want to follow medical advice, investigate if there is a way to combine their plans with the standard medical regimen.\\nIdentify possible barriers to care based on culture. Ask the patient if there is anything that would \\nprevent them from seeking care in a standard medical institution. Probe for explanations and what may increase the chance of maintaining a good patient-physician relationship.\\nMotivational interviewingCounseling technique to facilitate behavior modification by helping patients resolve ambivalence \\nabout change. Useful for many conditions (eg, nicotine dependence, obesity). Helpful when patient has some desire to change, but it does not require that the patient be committed to making the change. May involve asking patients to examine how their behavior interferes with their life or why they might want to change it. Assess barriers (eg, food access, untreated trauma) that may make behavior change difficult.\\nAssessing a patient’s readiness for change is also important for guiding physician-suggested goals. \\nThese goals should be S pecific, M easurable, A chievable, R elevant, and T ime bound ( SMART ).\\nTrauma-informed care Patients with history of psychological trauma should receive thorough behavioral health screenings. \\nRegularly assess mood, substance use, social supports, and suicide risk.\\nFocus assessments on trauma-related symptoms that interfere with social and occupational \\nfunction. Always be empathetic. Do not ask invasive questions requiring the patient to describe trauma in detail. Ask permission prior to discussion.\\nBefore the physical exam, reassure patients that they may signal to end it immediately if they \\nexperience too much physical or emotional discomfort. Offer the presence of additional staff for support. Psychological counseling may be indicated. Follow-up counseling is offered (or advised) as appropriate.

However, if you believe the patient might seriously harm self or others if informed, you may invoke therapeutic privilege and withhold the information.\\nA 17-year-old is pregnant and \\nrequests an abortion .Many states require parental notification or consent for minors for an abortion. Unless \\nthere are specific medical risks associated with pregnancy, a physician should not sway the patient’s decision for, or against, an elective abortion (regardless of patient’s age or fetal condition).

Accompanying caregivers can add information to any discussion as needed.\\nAsk if assistance is desired rather than assuming the patient cannot do something alone. Most \\npeople, including people with disabilities, value their independence.\\nFor patients with speech difficulties, provide extra time for the interview. If their speech is difficult \\nto understand, consider asking them to write down a few words or ask them to rephrase their sentence. Repeat what they said to ensure you understood it correctly.\\nFor patients with a cognitive impairment, use concrete, specific language. Ask simple, direct \\nquestions. Eliminate background noise and distractions. Do not assume the patient can read. Adjust to how the patient understands best (eg, use hand gestures or ask them to demonstrate a task).\\nAsk patients who are deaf or hard of hearing their preferred mode of communication. Use light \\ntouch or waving to get their attention. For patients who prefer to speak and lipread, eliminate background noise, face the patient, and do not change your mode of speaking. Consider using an interpreter when necessary.\\nAs with other parts of a medical history, do not bring up a disability if it is not relevant to a visit (eg, \\na patient in a wheelchair with an ear infection). Do not skip relevant parts of the physical exam even if the disability makes the exam challenging.\\nUse of interpreters Visits with a patient who speaks little English should utilize a professionally trained medical \\ninterpreter unless the physician is conversationally fluent in the patient’s preferred language. If an interpreter is unavailable in person, interpretation services may be provided by telephone or video call. If the patient prefers to utilize a family member, this should be recorded in the chart.\\nDo not assume that a patient is a poor English speaker because of name, skin tone, or accent.

Within each Organ System are several subsections, including \\nEmbryology, Anatomy, Physiology, Pathology, and Pharmacology. As \\nyou progress through each Organ System, refer back to information in the previous subsections to organize these basic science subsections into a “vertically integrated” framework for learning. Below is some general advice for studying the organ systems by these subsections.\\nEmbryology\\nRelevant embryology is included in each organ system subsection. Embryology tends to correspond well with the relevant anatomy, especially with regard to congenital malformations.\\nAnatomy\\nSeveral topics fall under this heading, including gross anatomy, histology, and neuroanatomy. Do not memorize all the small details; however, do not ignore anatomy altogether. Review what you have already learned and what you wish you had learned. Many questions require two or more steps. The first step is to identify a structure on anatomic cross section, electron micrograph, or photomicrograph. The second step may require an understanding of the clinical significance of the structure.\\nWhile studying, emphasize clinically relevant material. For example, be \\nfamiliar with gross anatomy and radiologic anatomy  related to specific diseases \\n(eg, Pancoast tumor, Horner syndrome), traumatic injuries (eg, fractures, sensory and motor nerve deficits), procedures (eg, lumbar puncture), and common surgeries (eg, cholecystectomy). There are also many questions on the exam involving x-rays, CT scans, and neuro MRI scans. Many students suggest browsing through a general radiology atlas, pathology atlas, and histology atlas. Focus on learning basic anatomy at key levels in the body (eg,\\xa0 sagittal brain MRI; axial CT of the midthorax, abdomen, and pelvis). Basic neuroanatomy (especially pathways, blood supply, and functional anatomy), associated neuropathology, and neurophysiology have good yield. Please note that many of the photographic images in this book are for illustrative purposes and are not necessarily reflective of Step 1 emphasis.\\nPhysiology\\nThe portion of the examination dealing with physiology is broad and concept oriented and thus does not lend itself as well to fact-based review. Diagrams are often the best study aids, especially given the increasing number of questions requiring the interpretation of diagrams. Learn to apply basic physiologic relationships in a variety of ways (eg, the Fick equation, clearance equations). You are seldom asked to perform complex calculations.

Thus, it is worthwhile to review the physiologic changes that are found with common pathologies of the major organ systems (eg, heart, lungs, kidneys, GI tract) and endocrine glands.\\nPathology\\nQuestions dealing with this discipline are difficult to prepare for because of the sheer volume of material involved. Review the basic principles and hallmark characteristics of the key diseases. Given the clinical orientation of Step 1, it is no longer sufficient to know only the “buzzword” associations of certain diseases (eg, café-au-lait macules and neurofibromatosis); you must also recognize the clinical descriptions of these high-yield physical exam findings.\\nGiven the clinical slant of the USMLE Step 1, it is also important to \\nreview the classic presenting signs and symptoms of diseases as well as their associated laboratory findings. Delve into the signs, symptoms, and pathophysiology of major diseases that have a high prevalence in the United States (eg, alcohol use disorder, diabetes, hypertension, heart failure, ischemic heart disease, infectious disease). Be prepared to think one step beyond the simple diagnosis to treatment or complications. \\nThe examination includes a number of color photomicrographs and \\nphotographs of gross specimens that are presented in the setting of a brief clinical history. However, read the question and the choices carefully before looking at the illustration, because the history will help you identify the pathologic process. Flip through an illustrated pathology textbook, color atlases, and appropriate Web sites in order to look at the pictures in the days before the exam. Pay attention to potential clues such as age, sex, ethnicity, occupation, recent activities and exposures, and specialized lab tests.\\nPharmacology\\nPreparation for questions on pharmacology is straightforward. Learning all the key drugs and their characteristics (eg, mechanisms, clinical use, and important adverse effects) is high yield. Focus on understanding the prototype drugs in each class. Avoid memorizing obscure derivatives. Learn the “classic” and distinguishing toxicities of the major drugs. Do not bother with drug dosages or brand names. Reviewing associated biochemistry, physiology, and microbiology can be useful while studying pharmacology. There is a strong emphasis on ANS, CNS, antimicrobial, and cardiovascular agents as well as NSAIDs. Much of the material is clinically relevant. Newer drugs on the market are also fair game.\\nFAS1_2024_07-Cardio.indd   281FAS1_2024_07-Cardio.indd   281 1/30/24   12:56 PM1/30/24   12:56 PM'),\n",

Focusing on understanding the mechanisms instead of memorizing the details can make a big difference. Pathophysiology of atherosclerosis and heart failure, mechanism of action of drugs (particularly, their interplay with cardiac physiology) and their adverse effects, ECGs of heart blocks, the cardiac cycle, and the Starling curve are some of the more high-yield topics. Differentiating between systolic and diastolic dysfunction is also very important. Heart murmurs and maneuvers that affect these murmurs have also been high yield and may be asked in a multimedia format.Cardiovascular\\nFAS1_2024_07-Cardio.indd   283FAS1_2024_07-Cardio.indd   283 1/30/24   12:56 PM1/30/24   12:56 PM'),\n",

Generally speaking, endocrine diseases can be classified either as diseases of underproduction or overproduction, or as conditions involving the development of mass lesions—which themselves may be associated with underproduction or overproduction of hormones. Therefore, study the endocrine system first by learning the glands, their hormones, and their regulation, and then by integrating disease manifestations with diagnosis and management.

Within each section, resources are arranged first by Rating and then alphabetically by the first author within each Rating group.\\nA letter rating scale with six different grades reflects the detailed student \\nevaluations for Rated Resources. Each rated resource receives a rating as \\nfollows:\\nA+ Excellent for boards review.\\nA \\nA− Very good for boards review; choose among the group.\\nB+ \\n B Good, but use only after exhausting better resources.\\nB−  Fair, but there are many better resources in the discipline; or low-yield subject material.\\nThe rating is meant to reflect the overall usefulness of the resource in helping medical students prepare for the USMLE Step 1. This is based on a number of factors, including:\\n \\x83The importance of the discipline for the USMLE Step 1\\n \\x83The appropriateness and accuracy of the material\\n \\x83The readability of the text, where applicable\\n \\x83The quality and number of sample questions\\n \\x83The quality of written answers to sample questions\\n \\x83The cost\\n \\x83The quality of the user interface and learning experience, for web and mobile apps\\n \\x83The quality and appropriateness of the images and illustrations\\n \\x83The length of the text (longer is not necessarily better)\\n \\x83The quality and number of other resources available in the same discipline\\nPlease note that ratings do not reflect the quality of the resources for purposes other than reviewing for the USMLE Step 1. Many books with lower ratings are well written and informative but are not ideal for boards \\nFAS1_2024_18_PrintEditionBookRev.indd   740FAS1_2024_18_PrintEditionBookRev.indd   740 1/30/24   12:29 PM1/30/24   12:29 PM'),\n",

We also \\ninclude Summary Comments that describe their style and overall utility for \\nstudying. Finally, each recommended resource receives a Rating. Within each section, resources are arranged first by Rating and then alphabetically by the first author within each Rating group.\\nA letter rating scale with six different grades reflects the detailed student \\nevaluations for Rated Resources. Each rated resource receives a rating as \\nfollows:\\nA+ Excellent for boards review.\\nA \\nA− Very good for boards review; choose among the group.\\nB+ \\n B Good, but use only after exhausting better resources.\\nB−  Fair, but there are many better resources in the discipline; or low-yield subject material.\\nThe rating is meant to reflect the overall usefulness of the resource in helping medical students prepare for the USMLE Step 1. This is based on a number of factors, including\\n \\x83The importance of the discipline for the USMLE Step 1\\n \\x83The appropriateness and accuracy of the material\\n \\x83The readability of the text, where applicable\\n \\x83The quality and number of sample questions\\n \\x83The quality of written answers to sample questions\\n \\x83The cost\\n \\x83The quality of the user interface and learning experience, for web and mobile apps\\n \\x83The quality and appropriateness of the images and illustrations\\n \\x83The length of the text (longer is not necessarily better)\\n \\x83The quality and number of other resources available in the same discipline\\nPlease note that ratings do not reflect the quality of the resources for purposes other than reviewing for the USMLE Step 1.

Omits obscure material and dis-\\ntills high-yield information. Best used after a first readthrough of First Aid. Each explanation includes references from First Aid. However, the proportion of questions covering a given subject may not reflect the actual exam’s relative emphasis.

To this effect, the organization of this book \\nfollows that  of most primary texts in the field and parallels the syllabus used in \\npathophysiology courses in  medical schools throughout the United States. Ample space is \\nprovided for students to make notes during course study and while viewing the online \\nvideos that cover each section of the  text (www.pathoma.com).\\nWe recommend that students use Fundamentals of Pathology during their medical \\ncourses, taking notes in the margin as pertinent topics are covered. When exam time \\ncomes around,  these notes will likely be invaluable.\\nFor examination preparation, we suggest students read the material first, then listen to \\nthe online lecture, and then reread the material to develop a solid grasp of each topic. One \\nshould not become disheartened if they are not able to retain all the information \\ncontained herein. This deceptively slim volume covers a tremendous amount of material, \\nand repetition will be a key aid as you progress i n your studies.\\nAn effort has been made to emphasize concepts and principles over random facts, \\nthe forest rather than the trees. Attention to the same by the student will provide a deeper, \\nmore  meaningful understanding of human disease.

Metaplasia occurs via reprogramming of stem cells, which then produce the new cell\\ntype.\\n1 . Metaplasia is reversible, in theory, with removal of the driving stressor.\\n2.

For example, Barrett esophagus may progress to adenocarcinoma ofthe\\nesophagus.\\n2. A notable exception is apocrine metaplasia of breast, which carries no increased\\nrisk for cancer.\\nE.Vitamin A deficiency can also result in metaplasia.\\n1 . Vitamin A is necessary for differentiation of specialized epithelial surfaces such\\nas the conjunctiva covering the eye.\\n2.In vitamin A deficiency, thethin squamous lining of the conjunctiva undergoes\\nmetaplasia into stratified keratinizing squamous epithelium. This change is\\ncalled keratomalacia (Fig. 1.3).\\nF . Mesenchymal (connective) tissues can also undergo metaplasia.\\n1 .

BASIC PRINCIPLES\\nA.Cellular injury occurs when a stress exceeds the cell's ability to adapt.\\nB.The likelihood of injury depends on the type of stress, its severity, and the type of cell\\naffected.\\n1.Neurons are highly susceptible toischemic injury; whereas, skeletal muscle is\\nrelatively more resistant.\\n2.Slowly developing ischemia (e.g., renal artery atherosclerosis) results in atrophy;\\nwhereas, acute ischemia (e.g., renal artery embolus) results in injury.\\nC.Common causes of cellular injury include inflammation, nutritional deficiency or\\nexcess, hypoxia, trauma, and genetic mutations.\\nII. HYPOXIA\\nA.Low oxygen delivery to tissue; important cause of cellular injury\\n1.Oxygen is the final electron acceptor in the electron transport chain of oxidative\\nphosphorylation.\\n2.Decreased oxygen impairs oxidative phosphorylation, resulting in decreased ATP\\nproduction.\\n3.Lack ofATP (essential energy source) leads to cellular injury.\\nB.Causes of hypoxia include ischemia, hypoxemia, and decreased O2-carry\\ning capacity\\nof blood.\\nC.Ischemia is decreased blood flow through an organ. Arises with\\n1.Decreased arterial perfusion (e.g., atherosclerosis)\\n2.Decreased venous drainage (e.g., Budd-Chiari syndrome)\\n3.Shock - generalized hypotension resulting in poor tissue perfusion\\nD.Hypoxemia isa low partial pressure of oxygen in the blood (Pao2<60mm Hg, Sao2<\\n90%). Arises with\\n1.High altitude - Decreased barometric pressure results in decreased P Ao2•\\n2.Hypoventilation - Increased P Aco2results in decreased P Ao2•\\n3.Diffusion defect - PAo2not able to push as much O2into the blood due toa\\nthicker\\ndiffusion barrier (e.g., interstitial pulmonary fibrosis)\\n4.V/Q mismatch - Blood bypasses oxygenated lung (circulation problem, e.g., right-\\nto-left shunt), or oxygenated air cannot reach blood (ventilation problem,\\ne.g., atelectasis).\\nE.Decreased O2-carrying capacity arises with hemoglobin (Hb) loss or dysfunction.\\nExamples include\\n1.Anemia (decrease in RBC ma\\nss)-Pao normal; Sao normal2 2\\n2.Carbon monoxide poisoning\\nFig. 1.3 Keratomalacia.

P-selectin release from Weibel-Palade bodies is mediated by histamine.\\nii. E-selectin is induced by TNF and IL-1.\\n2. Selectins bind sialyl Lewis X on leukocytes.\\n3. Interaction results in rolling of leukocytes along vessel wall.\\nC.Step 3 - Adhesion\\n1. Cellular adhesion molecules (ICAM and VCAM) are upregulated on\\nendothelium by TNF and IL-1.\\n2. Integrins are upregulated on leukocytes by C5a and LTB4•\\n3. Interaction between CAMs and integrins results in firm adhesion of leukocytes to\\nthe vessel wall.\\n4. Leukocyte adhesion deficiency is most commonly due to an autosomal recessive\\ndefect of integrins (CD18 subunit).\\ni. Clinical features include delayed separation of the umbilical cord, increased\\ncirculating neutrophils (due to impaired adhesion of marginated pool of\\nleukocytes), and recurrent bacterial infections that lack pus formation.\\nD.Step 4 - Transmigration and Chemotaxis\\n1. Leukocytes transmigrate across the endothelium of postcapillary venules and\\nmove toward chemical attractants (chemotaxis).\\n2. Neutrophils are attracted by bacterial products, IL-8, C5a, and LTB4.\\nE.Step 5 - Phagocytosis\\n1. Consumption of pathogens or necrotic tissue; phagocytosis is enhanced by\\nopsonins (IgG and C3b).\\n2. Pseudopods extend from leukocytes to form phagosomes, which are internalized\\nand merge with lysosomes to produce phagolysosomes.\\n3. Chediak-Higashi syndrome is a protein trafficking defect (autosomal recessive)\\ncharacterized by impaired phagolysosome formation. Clinical features include\\ni. Increased risk of pyogenic infections\\nii. Neutropenia (due to intramedullary death of neutrophils)\\niii. Giant granules in leukocytes (due to fusion of granules arising from the Golgi\\napparatus)\\niv. Defective primary hemostasis (due to abnormal dense granules in platelets)\\nv. Albinism\\nvi. Peripheral neuropathy\\nF.Step 6 - Destruction of phagocytosed material\\n1. O2-dependent killing is the most effective mechanism.\\n2. HOCl generated by oxidative burst in phagolysosomes destroys phagocytosed\\nmicrobes.\\ni.

ROLE OF SCREENING\\nA.Cancer begins as a single mutated cell. \\nB.Approximately 30 divisions occur before the earliest clinical symptoms arise. \\nC.Each division (doubling time) results in increased mutations. \\n1.Cancers that do not produce symptoms until late in disease will have undergone \\nadditional divisions and, hence, additional mutations. \\n2.Cancers that are detected late tend to have a poor prognosis. \\n3.Screening seeks to catch dysplasia (precancerous change) before it becomes \\ncarcinoma or carcinoma before clinical symptoms arise; efficacy of screening, \\nhowever, requires a decrease in cancer-specific mortality. \\nD.Common screening methods include \\n1.Pap smear - detects cervical dysplasia (CIN) before it becomes carcinoma \\n2.Mammography - detects in situ breast cancer (e.g., DCIS) before it invades or \\ninvasive carcinoma before it becomes clinically palpable \\n3.Prostate specific antigen (PSA) and digital rectal exam - detects prostate \\ncarcinoma before it spreads \\n4.Hemoccult test (for occult blood in stool) and colonoscopy - detect colonic \\nadenoma before it becomes colonic carcinoma or carcinoma before it spreads \\nCARCINOGENESIS  \\nI.BASIC PRINCIPLES\\nA.Cancer formation is initiated by damage to DNA of stem cells. The damage \\novercomes DNA repair mechanisms, but is not lethal. \\n1.Carcinogens are agents that damage DNA, increasing the risk for cancer. \\nImportant carcinogens include chemicals, oncogenic viruses, and radiation \\n(Table 3.2). \\nB.DNA mutations eventually disrupt key regulatory systems, allowing for tumor \\npromotion (growth) and progression (spread). \\n1.Disrupted systems include proto-oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, and \\nregulators of apoptosis. \\nII. ONCOGENES\\nA.Proto-oncogenes are essential for cell growth and differentiation; mutations of\\nproto-oncogenes form oncogenes that lead to unregulated cellular growth. \\nB.Categories of oncogenes include growth factors, growth factor receptors, signal \\ntransducers, nuclear regulators, and cell cycle regulators (Tab le 3.3). \\n1.Growth factors induce cellular growth (e.g., PDGFB in astrocytoma). \\n2.Growth factor receptors mediate signals from growth factors (e.g., ERBB2 \\n[HER2/neu] in breast cancer). \\n3.Signal transducers relay receptor activation to the nucleus (e.g., ras).

It's characterized by an abnormal keratinocyte desquamation, increased sebum production, and colonization of the pilosebaceous unit by Cutibacterium acnes, leading to inflammation.\n",
